## Description

Below query detects DLL Hijacking scenario of planting a DLL having an invalid signature in a different folder and making an application load it instead of the original DLL.


## How the Query Works
Applications load DLLs from known directories. When hijacking occurs, the application starts loading the DLL from a different directory. The query performs historical comparison of directories where DLLs are loaded from and detects DLLs when they are loaded from an unusual directory. Because there are randomly named directories, the query performs normalization on them to reduce false positives. In-house/custom developed applications may still generate FPs. You can filter them out if needed. If you still get lots of FPs because of randomly named directories, uncomment the section mentioned in the query.
