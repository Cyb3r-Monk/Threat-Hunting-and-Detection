Language: Azure KQL

Products: Azure Sentinel

Required: Sysmon Network Connection Events.  You may need to modify Sysmon parsing function in the query.


## Description

Below query detects suspicious beaconing activity by analyzing Sysmon network connection events.

## How to use the query
We first need to define boundaries for the beacons you want to detect. Defining the boundaries based on the Empire beacon behavior covers Cobalt Strike and others.
### Hunting with the jitter only
In this scenario, we want to detect all beacons without filtering them based on the sleep interval. Just change the JitterThreshold and run the query.
### Hunting with the jitter and sleep interval
In this scenario, we want to filter beacons based on the jitter and sleep interval thresholds. 
#### Example: Beacons that have at least 15-minute(900s) sleep with %25 jitter
JitterThreshold = 25
TimeDeltaThresholdMin = 900 -  (900*25/100) = 675 = 11 minutes, 15 seconds

Optionally, we want to set an upper boundary for the sleep interval:
TimeDeltaThresholdMax = 900 + (900*25/100) = 1125= 18 minutes, 45 seconds

Based on these values, we can filter the results.

// Read the blog to understand how this query works and how to analyze the results.
// This query may not be able to detect beacons that have large sleep values like 6h-1d. Refactoring and additional analysis are required. 
//
// Query parameters:
let starttime = 1d;
let endtime = 1s;
// Set the minimum beacon sleep. Increase it to get less results. the format is (hour,minute,second.milisecond).
// Be careful when changing the value. run " print ['timespan'] = make_timespan(0, x, y) " to verify you have the correct value set. 
let TimeDeltaThresholdMin = make_timespan(0,0,0.001); 
let TotalEventsThresholdMin = 15;
let TotalEventsThresholdMax=toint(((totimespan(starttime) - totimespan(endtime))/TimeDeltaThresholdMin));
let JitterThreshold = 50; // jitter in percentage. Set to filter out false positives: small threshold means tighter filtering/fewer results.
// Outlier thresholds. 1.5 means the value is a normal outlier, 3 means the value is far far out.
let OutlierThresholdMax = 2; //increase or decrease this value to get more or less results
// Time delta data set can have some outliers. Define how many outliers are acceptable for a beacon. Values between 1 to 3 should be fine.
let OutlierCountMax = 2; // increasing the value provides more results.
// Define how many devices can have the same beacon. 
let CompromisedDeviceCountMax = 10; // increasing the value provides more results. 
// Function for parsing Sysmon network connection events.
