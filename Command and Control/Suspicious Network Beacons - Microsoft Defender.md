Language: Azure KQL

Products: Microsoft 365 Defender / Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

Required: DeviceNetworkEvents  

**WARNING!**: Since MDE doesn't log every single network connection, there is a chance of FALSE NEGATIVES. 


## Description

Below query detects suspicious beaconing activity by analyzing DeviceNetworkEvents data.

## How to use the query
We first need to define boundaries for the beacons you want to detect. Defining the boundaries based on the Empire beacon behavior covers Cobalt Strike and others.
### Hunting with the jitter only
In this scenario, we want to detect all beacons without filtering them based on the sleep interval. Just change the JitterThreshold and run the query.
### Hunting with the jitter and sleep interval
In this scenario, we want to filter beacons based on the jitter and sleep interval thresholds. 
#### Example: Beacons that have at least 15-minute(900s) sleep with %25 jitter
JitterThreshold = 25
TimeDeltaThresholdMin = 900 -  (900*25/100) = 675 = 11 minutes, 15 seconds

Optionally, we want to set an upper boundary for the sleep interval:
TimeDeltaThresholdMax = 900 + (900*25/100) = 1125= 18 minutes, 45 seconds

Based on these values, we can filter the results.

// Read the blog to understand how this query works and how to analyze the results.

// Query parameters:

// Set the minimum beacon sleep. Increase it to get less results. the format is (hour,minute,second.milisecond).

// Outlier thresholds. 1.5 means the value is a normal outlier, 3 means the value is far far out.

// Time delta data set can have some outliers. Define how many outliers are acceptable for a beacon. Values between 1 to 3 should be fine.

// Define how many devices can have the same beacon.
