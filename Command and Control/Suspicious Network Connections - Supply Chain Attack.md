Language: Azure KQL

Products: Microsoft 365 Defender / Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

Required: DeviceNetworkEvents, DeviceInfo


## Description

Below query detects unusual network conenctions from servers that have 3rd party software installed.  
You can further improve the query by using a list of servers that have privileges across the whole domain.



**Query:**

```C#
// Author: Cyb3rMonk(https://twitter.com/Cyb3rMonk, https://mergene.medium.com)

// Query parameters:
let lookback = 14d; 
// Generate list of all Servers
let server_list = 
    DeviceInfo

// Generate list of servers that have 3rd party software installed.
// Criteria: if a software is installed on less than 10 servers, it's probably a 3rd party software.
// There are probably(hopefully) just a few servers or server groups that have privileges across the whole domain.
// You can change the threshold according to your environment.
