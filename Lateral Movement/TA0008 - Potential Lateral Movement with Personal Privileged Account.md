Required: IdentityLogonEvents


## Description

Below query detects potential Lateral Movement that involves personal privileged accounts.  
Since valid accounts are used for Lateral Movement, it covers Valid Accounts technique as well.
ATTENTION: You need to modify to query according to your environment.

**Query:**

//
//
//              How to use this query:
//              Modify the "Admin account condition" sections according to your environment. Set query time to 15d or 30d.
//              If a personal privileged account gets compromised, it would be used from the same machine as it was usually used from. 
//              If you want to see the results where there is no associated alert, change the value ShowResultsWithNoAlerts to 'YES'. Otherwise, set it to 'NO'.
//              
//              In an attack involving Lateral Movement or Valid Accounts, you might expect to see at least one alert related to either the source device, the target device or the identity(normal or admin account) account. 
//              Admin accounts are expected to be used from the same devices. If the account is seen on a new source/target device (IsSourceUsedBefore=No, IsTargetUsedBefore=No), it may be anomalous.
//              Some Admin accounts have privileges on many devices(helpdesk, Windows admins). SourceCount and TargetCount gives an idea about the account usage.
//              
//              Explanations of the custom fields in the results:
//              IsSourceUsedBefore/IsTargetUsedBefore: if the acount has used Source/Target device before. 
//              AccountSourceCount/AccountTargetCount: Number of distinct Source/Target Devices that the account has used before.
//              Job Title: Job title of the personal account(if exists in the IdentityInfo table). If you don't have the table, remove the enrichment.
