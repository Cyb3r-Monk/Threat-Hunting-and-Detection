Required: IdentityLogonEvents


## Description

Below query detects potential Lateral Movement that involves service or non-personal privileged accounts.  
Since valid accounts are used for Lateral Movement, it covers Valid Accounts technique as well.  
ATTENTION: You need to modify to query according to your environment.

**Query:**

//
//              How to use this query:
//              Modify the "Service account condition" sections according to your environment. Set query time to 15d or 30d.
//              It is quite suspicious if a service account is used from a new source (espcially from a workstation)
//              If you want to see the results where there is no associated alert, change the value ShowResultsWithNoAlerts to 'YES'. Otherwise, set it to 'NO'.
//              
//              In an attack involving lateral movement or valid accounts, you might expect to see at least one alert related to either the source device, the destination device or the service account. 
//              Service accounts are expected to be used on the same devices. If the account was seen on a new source device (IsSourcedUsedBefore=No), it may be anomalous.
//              Service accounts are usually seen on servers. If the source device type is workstation, it's quite anomalous. Check IsSourcedUsedBefore info.
//              Some service accounts used to deploy stuff on all devices. SourceCount and TargetCount gives an idea about the account usage/type.
//              
//              Explanations of the custom fields in the results:
//              IsSourceUsedBefore/IsTargetUsedBefore: if the acount has used Source/Target device before. 
//              AccountSourceCount/AccountTargetCount: Number of distinct Source/Target Devices that the account has used before.
//
