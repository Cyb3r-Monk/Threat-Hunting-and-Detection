Language: Azure KQL

Products: M365D. For MDE, you need to customize the query and use DeviceAlertEvents table.

Coverage: Lateral Movement with Local Accounts only  

Required: DeviceLogonEvents


## Description

Below query detects potential Lateral Movement that involves local accounts.  
Since valid accounts are used for Lateral Movement, it covers Valid Accounts technique as well.  
ATTENTION: You need to modify to query according to your environment.

**Query:**

//
//    How to use this query:
//    Set query time to 15d or 30d. Populate the DomainList below.
//    It is quite suspicious if a local account is used from a new source (espcially from a workstation)
//    If you want to see the results where there is no associated alert, change the value ShowResultsWithNoAlerts to 'YES'. Otherwise, set it to 'NO'.
//    
//    In an attack involving lateral movement or valid accounts, you might expect to see at least one alert related to either the source device, the destination device or the local account. 
//    Local accounts are expected to be used from specific devices. If the account was used from a new source device (IsSourcedUsedBefore=No), it may be anomalous.
//    
//    Explanations of the custom fields in the results:
//    IsSourceUsedBefore/IsTargetUsedBefore: if the acount has used Source/Target device before. 
//    AccountSourceCount/AccountTargetCount: Number of distinct Source/Target Devices that the account has used befor
//
