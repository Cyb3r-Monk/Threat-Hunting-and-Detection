**Link to Original Post**: [Medium](https://posts.bluraven.io/detecting-ntlm-relay-attacks-d92e99e68fb9)

Language: Azure KQL

Products: Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE/M365D)

Required: DeviceLogonEvents, DeviceInfo,  (machine and user logon events)

**!!! Important !!!:** If you have Windows Server 2012 in your environment, you may need to use the new MDE agents. The old agents that use the OMS agent don't log NTLM logons properly.


## Description

The below query detects NTLM logons where Network Address in the logon event doesn't match the Workstation Name's IP. This indicates potentially relayed NTLM authentication. It analyzes only the logons with domain accounts having admin privileges.



## How to use theÂ query
Populate the `domains` and `SNAT_Subnets` lists accordingly and run the query.



**Query:**
