FP Rate: Very Low

## Description

Detects kerberoasting by using time-series analysis functions. Highly accurate in big environments.

Step by step explanation is in the query to make it easy to understand. 

**Query:**

```C#
// create a whitelist that consists of your AD domain names. ex: ("contoso.com","contoso.local","contoso.dmz")
let _whitelist_ServiceName = dynamic (["contoso.com","contoso.local","contoso.dmz"]);
let _fromDate = ago(8d);
let _thruDate = now();
let _min_dcount_threshold = 6;
let _period =2h; // this value should also be used as the rule frequency.
// If an account requested more than <_min_dcount_threshold> service tickets during the last <_period> hour, 
// we need to check if it is suspicious or not by looking at historical data for the same user. 
// STEP 1: Create a list of accounts to be checked based on their requests during the last <_period> hour.
// This approach also increases the rule performance as only the suspicious accounts are checked historically.
let _accounts_to_be_checked =
    SecurityEvent

    | parse EventData with * 'Status">' Status "<" *
    | where Status == '0x0'

// STEP 3: Find outliers(anomalies) in the time-series data and make a list of suspicious accounts.
let AnomTargetUserNames = (

    | mvexpand dcount_ServiceName, TimeGenerated, outliers to typeof(double)
    // dcount must be at least greater than the threshold. otherwise small numbers can also be an outlier.
	// ex: 1,1,1,1,5 -> 5 is an outlier but probably not suspicious in big environment
    | where dcount_ServiceName > _min_dcount_threshold
    // time-series function rounds the time information and displays the time info as the startofday like '2020-08-23T00:00:00.0000000Z'. 
	// check if the anomlay happened on the current day.
    | where TimeGenerated >= startofday(now())
    // we are looking for positive outliers, meaning increase in the volume.
    // this threshold can be adjusted based on the number of false positives or false negatives
    | where outliers > 1.5
    // we are looking for big outliers. Top 25 outliers should be more than enough. 
    | top 25 by outliers desc
    | summarize make_list(TargetUserName)
    );
// STEP 4: Anomaly is found but it's not clear when it happened exactly and there is not enough information for incident response.
//         Get last <_period> of data and dcount of service names, set of service names that have been requested for each account in the anomalous account list.
//         Join with the baseData as it has both avg values and other details of the anomaly. 
//         Avg value will also be used for preventing the rule from triggering the same alert again.  
//         We already found the anomalous users but we need to check if the anomaly happened in the last <_period> to prevent duplicate incidents.
