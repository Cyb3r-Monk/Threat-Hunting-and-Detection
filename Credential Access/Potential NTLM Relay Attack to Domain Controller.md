Language: Azure KQL

Products: Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE/M365D)

Required: DeviceLogonEvents


## Description

Below query detects NTLM authentication coming from Domain Controller machine accounts. This is not an expected behavior and it's an indication of NTLM relay attack.  
If NTLM Relaying is done towards a Linux machine, this query won't detect that. The attacker must have access to a Linux device in that case though.



## How to use theÂ query
Populate the `DCs`(must be FQDN of the DCs) lists and run the query



**Query:**
